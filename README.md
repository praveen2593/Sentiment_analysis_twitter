## Perform Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Stream Data

I am interested in performing a sentiment analysis on twitter stream data. I used an event recently, which covers a historic transfer of a soccer player for the highest amount of money (grossing over $450 million) and I am interested in understanding the public reaction on the same.
Also, continuing with the data set, I am interested in identifying the power of emoji's in a tweet. I want to incorporate the emoji's while computing the sentiment orientation of a tweet. And in order to do this, I converted all unicode tweet into their names using unicodedata library.
